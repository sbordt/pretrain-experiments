# TODO's

- standardize evals (release evals?)

- when re-starting with long training stuff, will always restart from initial checkpoint again

allow max_steps to depend only on olmo config (just start once and let the olmo train until it ends).

- save init when training from scratch

- add option to automatically upload final checkpoint to hf_hub (also for intermediate checkpoints)

add  (asynch?) evals during training.

- refactor num_steps per control and num_steps to work for the different szenatios	

- handle config logic with better checks ... perhaps define a large args structure?

- move olmo insertions fully towards hdf5
